            <h3>I belive all digital devices kill our creativity, curiosity, and ability to learn.</h3>
            <p>So I worked as a book designer for more than 10 years.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, the rest of the world doesn't share my point of view. So here I am - a UX/UI designer.</p>
            <p>I'll try to make this world better though.</p>

            <h2>First day of the project</h2>
            <p>During our kick of meeting, the client told us that they want a new website.</p>
            <p class="side-note">Wow! This is very ambitious and a big ask for the team of three students to be done in the 4 month we had for this project.</p>
            <p>The client also said that their current website is built on Wordpress CMS.</p>
            <p class="side-note">Hoorey! I personally love Wordpress and I strongly believe that you can do everything on Wordpress platform.</p>
            <p>Our client had no idea of what UX//UI is and what exactly we could do for them. <span>“We need a new website”</span> is obviously too vague goal and doesn’t answer the most important for a uxer question - <span>why?</span> Why do you need a new website? What’s wrong with the current one? So we asked the client a bunch of questions to help clearly articulate their goals for this project and to help ourselves to understand the scope of the project; what direction we should go and what to expect from this project.</p>
            <p>We came up with this list of goals for the client:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wants a website redesign</li>
                <li>Wants a simpler donation process</li>
                <li>Wants to make clients more aware of services</li>
                <li>Wants to have less content</li>
                <li>Wants a simpler website</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The list of goals is great and helpful but it still doesn’t answer our question - <span>why</span>.</p>
            <p>To help ourselves to see the scope of the project, stay on track and meet deadline requirements, we created a project plan where we divided  the process into smaller tasks and set up due dates.</p>

            <p>Joey and Liv were focusing on interviews and usability testing while I was responsible for content audit.</p>
            <p class="side-note">I did participate in testing as an observer and conducted one usability testing session though. It was fun! And it also showed that certainly there are some problems in navigation and content presentation. However, from the testing we also learned that some areas are not as bad as the client thought they were!</p>
            <p>Let’s go back to my content audit. I decided to start by looking at the Wordpress dashboard to understand the website structure, focusing on the <span>main question “what and how we could improve”</span>. I was surprised and upset - the template of the website is controlled by corporate and local chapters are able to add only little to nothing of text and maybe images in some places. With permissions local chapters have, it is not possible to change the most important sections on the website.</p>
            <p>In our next meeting with stakeholders, we discussed the situation and agreed that there is no way to fix the existing website so we indeed need to switch our focus towards designing a brand new one.</p>
            <p>This new knowledge has changed my goals from what and how to change to <span>what content we could take from the existing website to the new future website</span>.</p>
            <h2>Content audit process</h2>
            <p>I tried to use some automated tools designed specifically for content audit but it didn’t work - the website security settings don’t allow “scanning” the website. The only thing I was able to do automatically is to get a website map.</p>
            <p>Well, ok. The website has only 26 pages. Not too bad! I can go through each page and manually review it. This is actually beneficial in terms of familiarizing myself with the company and what they do.</p>
            <p>Launching a new website is not easy and any fast which means that DFSA will be using the current website for a little bit longer. Having this in mind, I still included in my content audit analysis things that could be changed right now - like "click here" links are not acsessible and should be rephrased. Those findings are actually helpful to the customer so they could avoid the same mistakes in future.</p>
            <p>During this manual scanning of the website, a lot of additional questions were raised so we set up an additional meeting with Teal.</p>
            <p class="side-note">I loved her reaction when I showed her an infographic of her website: “I&nbsp;could see now that you're showing me that how it would be like that, but it's definitely not what we intended.”</p>
            <div class="thumbnails">
                <a class="lightbox" href="#img2"><img src="img/dfsa/inventory-chart.jpg" alt="handouts"></a>
                <div class="lightbox-target" id="img2">
                    <img src="img/dfsa/inventory-chart.jpg"  alt="handouts">
                    <a class="lightbox-close" href="#"></a>
                 </div>
            </div>
            <p>After this meeting, it was clear for everyone that the way the website is designed and information present there are not aligned with what DFSA is actually doing and trying to promote.</p>
            <p>Synthesizing my content audit results and answers we got from the in-depth interview with stakeholders, I created a vector to change information architecture. Appearantelly, some sections of the website were outdated, some didn’t have enough information, and some were in the wrong place.</p>
            <div class="thumbnails">
                <a class="lightbox" href="#img3"><img src="img/dfsa/DFSA-IA.jpg" alt="handouts"></a>
                <div class="lightbox-target" id="img3">
                    <img src="img/dfsa/DFSA-IA.jpg"  alt="handouts">
                    <a class="lightbox-close" href="#"></a>
                 </div>
            </div>
            <p>This suggested information architecture actually was supported and proven by usability testing results that Joey and Liv did.</p>
            <p>All the findings were reflected in our proposed website design ideas we worked on during next steps. But this is another story...</p>
