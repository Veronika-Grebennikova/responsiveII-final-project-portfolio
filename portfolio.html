                    <p>It was built by Ivan the Terrible. Stories and myths abound of Ivan’s raging temper, one of which involves him purposefully blinding the cathedral’s (unnamed) Italian architect so that its design could never be replicated.</p>

                    <p>Dumplings were very popular in Siberia and later in the 14th century were discovered by the Russian explorers. Frozen meat dumplings are ideal for the cold climate. They can be perfectly preserved through the winter without losing their characteristics, and meat, hidden in the dough, does not attract wild animals.</p>

                    <p>Usually Maslenitsa lasts for seven days and on the last day of this holiday people burn a doll which is made of branches and straw and dressed in bright clothes. This doll is called “Maslenitsa” and it symbolizes the cold and severe winter.</p>

                    <p>Sergius (Russian: Тро́ице-Се́ргиева Ла́вра) is the most important Russian monastery and the spiritual centre of the Russian Orthodox Church. The monastery is situated in the town of Sergiyev Posad, about 70 km to the north-east from Moscow by the road leading to Yaroslavl, and currently is home to over 300 monks.</p>

                    <p>The Trans-Siberian covers a staggering eight different time-zones. However, all timetables and station clocks are in Moscow time. Good luck with not missing your train. The middle of the Trans-Siberian railway is a station called Половина (Polovina) meaning “Middle”. It is the same distance from both Moscow and Vladivostok.</p>

                    <p>Thousands of abandoned villages are scattered across northern Russia. Many have become uninhabited due to a lack of infrastructure and jobs. Poor quality roads make some regions unreachable, so people have to save food for weeks ahead, especially in early spring when the frozen rivers begin to melt and before ferries are operational.</p>
